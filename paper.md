# 1. Info about your Game, Game Development Team, your role and lessons learned
The *short* trailer for the game can be seen [\color{blue}{here}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF0C61Sxbhg).

The game binaries for Linux, Mac, and Windows can download from [\color{blue}{here}](https://tinyurl.com/nightmare-hotel), please download the entire folder that is needed for your platform.

## 1.a Your game?
Nightmare Hotel

## 1.b GameDev Team
FrandseGames

## 1.c Team members
Jens Jakúp Gaardbo, Fredrik Dam Hansen, Simon Frandsen, Daniel Kartin, Søren Skouv

## 1.e Common vision
Stealth Goblin Action.

## 1.f Your role
I primarily worked with Game design, level design, programming, 2D art, and animation. [394]

## 1.g Lessons Learned
1. Commit often, and write better commit messages.
2. A hacky solution is still a solution.
3. Getting everything put together in the end, takes longer than initially thought.

## 5.b
The entire project is hosted on github, the zipped (un-imported) project is around 36.9 MB.

## 5.c
For creating this game, we decided on using the Godot engine, it is an open source engine that allows for quick development of both 2D and 3D games. The graphics pipeline of Godot is OpenGl, and the physics engine is a modified version of box2D called Godot physics. Programming is all done inside the Godot editor. We used Aseprite and Piskel for the pixel art.
