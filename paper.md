The game binaries for Linux, Mac, and Windows can download from [\color{blue}{here}](https://tinyurl.com/nightmare-hotel), please download the entire folder that is needed for your platform.

## 1.a Your game?
Nightmare Hotel

## 1.b GameDev Team

## 1.d "Upgrade"?
Only noticeable change, was hopefully fixing a game breaking bug when entering a door, after having died, crashed the game.

Stealth Goblin Action.

## 1.f Your role
I primarily worked with Game design, level design, programming, 2D art, and animation. @TODO find ref for this
